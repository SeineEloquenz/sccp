# SCCP - SEUS Conquest Compatibility Patcher
[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

This python script serves as a compatibility patch for the
[SEUS Renewed](https://sonicether.com/shaders/download/renewed-v1-0-1/) shaderpack and the
[Conquest Resourcepack](http://conquest.ravand.org/) for Minecraft.

As SEUS is released under a proprietary license, one is not allowed to upload the fixed Shaderpack, so to automate
the patching process, this small project was created.
